      "The Fender American Professional II Strat HSS seen here in 3 Tone Sunburst MN, is the Stratocaster that does it all. This is a truly adaptable guitar that can let you do a full set without the need for multiple guitar changes. The newly designed pickups can go from heavy rock to pristine cleans; basically everything a working guitarist could need! Comfort has not been left out though, as can be felt by the rolled fingerboard edges and the Super Natural satin finish on the back of the Deep C neck profile. Add in a top grade tremolo bridge with bent steel saddles and you have one remarkable guitar.",

If there’s an effect for guitar (or bass, vocals, keys…be creative!) then you can bet BOSS have a pedal of it in their range or even invented it outright!

      "An icon reborn. The Boss DD-3T Digital Delay Pedal is an enhanced version of the legendary DD-3. It maintains all of the distinctive, recognisable sound of the original - but with improved functionality that makes adding a touch of stunning delay to your music, completely simple. With delay times ranging from 12.5 to 800ms, there's a huge spectrum to play with. And if you need to quickly find the right sound, the delay has been split into three subdivisions for rapid setup. A relocated direct output jack next to the main output makes connecting the pedal in a wet/dry setup hassle free. And you can tap in delay tempos using the onboard switch. All in all, the DD-3T makes finding the right delay sound for you effortless.",
